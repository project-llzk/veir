# SideEffectInterfaces

This file provides support for querying the side effects of operations.

  What memory effects may this operation have?

  NOTE: An operation with no memory effects is not necessarily speculatable: it
        may still have undefined behavior or fail to terminate. MLIR models
        these properties separately with `ConditionallySpeculatable`; Veir does
        not support this interface yet.

  if op.getNumRegions! ctx != 0 then .unknown else
  let opType := op.getOpType! ctx
  HasOpInfo.getEffects opType (op.getProperties! ctx opType)

/--
  Whether this operation is known to have no memory effects. This
  does not imply that the operation is safe to speculate: it may still
  affect control flow or trigger immediate undefined behavior.
