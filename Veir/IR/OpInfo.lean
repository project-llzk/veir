  The memory effects of an operation with this opcode and these properties,

  getEffects : (op : opCode) → propertiesOf op → MemoryEffects :=
    fun _ _ => .unknown
  /--
  Whether an operation with this opcode materializes a literal constant
  value: no operands, one result, no side effects, and a result that is
  always determined by the operation's properties. Defaults to `false`
  for every opcode, which conservatively treats nothing as constant.
  -/
  isConstantLike : opCode → Bool := fun _ => false
  /--
  Whether an operation with this opcode produces a wholly poisoned result
  whenever any one of its operands is wholly poison, mirroring LLVM's
  `propagatesPoison`. Defaults to `false` for every opcode, which
  conservatively propagates nothing.

  functionInterface? : (op : opCode) → Option (FunctionOpInterface (propertiesOf op)) :=

  /--
  Return the kind of the indexed region inside an operation with this opcode.
  This mirrors MLIR's `RegionKindInterface` default: regions are SSACFG unless
  the operation is known to define graph regions.
  -/
  getRegionKind : opCode → Nat → RegionKind := fun _ _ => .SSACFG
  /--
  Whether definitions in the indexed region must dominate their uses. A false
  result denotes graph-style semantics, where only a single block can be in the
  region, and operation order does not impose SSA dominance.
  -/
  hasSSADominance : opCode → Nat → Bool
  /--
  Whether the indexed region is exempt from the requirement that each of its
  blocks ends in a terminator, mirroring MLIR's `NoTerminator` trait.

  This is deliberately separate from the region kind. A graph region implies
  no terminator, but the converse does not hold: MLIR gives `pdl.rewrite` a
  body that is an ordinary SSACFG region and yet carries `NoTerminator`.
  Encoding such a region as a graph region would silently drop SSA dominance
  from the model in order to relax an unrelated requirement.

  Defaults to `false` for every opcode, which conservatively keeps the
  terminator requirement.

  Does this OpCode count as an MLIR basic block terminator?

  Whether this operation has MLIR's `IsolatedFromAbove` trait. Operations in
  each of its regions may only use values defined in that region or one of its
  nested regions.
