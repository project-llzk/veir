## External Sources

The accepted remote branch was checked with `git ls-remote origin
refs/heads/felt-review-structural-close` and recorded under
`reviews/PHASE-01/evidence/accepted-remote-branch.txt`.

No web page, issue, or mutable branch name is trusted without the exact commit
hash above. For LLZK source facts, `origin/main` is accepted only through the
exact commit `db922857bc5a88a9107627ef6b36a8b5e57bc5c2` and the recorded
`project-llzk/llzk-lib` origin remote.

The local LLVM checkout is used as test infrastructure, not as source truth for
LLZK or VeIR semantics.

## Contextual Non-Canonical Material

These files and references are useful context but are not canonical Phase 1 pin
evidence unless a future review revalidates a specific claim:

- `REVIEW.md`
- `FOLLOWUP.md`
- `baseline.txt`
- Source comments pointing at deleted `harness/coverage.md`,
  `harness/differential.md`, `harness/porting-notes.md`,
  `harness/regions-design.md`, or `plan.md`
- Historical branch/date references to `llzkfelt_test1` in archived evidence or
  old notes
- Local `../llzk-lib` worktree files while the worktree remains at
  `30b0fa1eb77de154ff60c13fa88ef286d8b01c65`
